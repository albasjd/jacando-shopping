# Jacando Shopping Server

#### This project uses Node.js, Express, GraphQL, Apollo, MongoDB, Mongoose

---

## Requirements

For development:

- you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your environment (LTS)
- you will need [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your environment (LTS)

---

### Setup

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as runtime environment  
Install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager

- You can find some instructions on how to install PNPM in Getting Started section

#### Checking everything is installed correctly

You should be able to run the following commands after the installation (versions can be higher).

```
$ node --version
v18.14.0
$ pnpm --version
7.30.3
```

---

## Getting started

- Install all project dependencies with `pnpm i` (alias for `pnpm install`)
- To run the app (development):
    - Start the development with `pnpm dev` (short for `pnpm run dev`)
- (check the `scripts` section in `package.json` for more commands)

**_TIPS_**:
> 1. Set up an alias for `pnpm` in your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file, simply add the following
     line: `alias pn=pnpm`
> 2. All scripts from package.json can omit `run` keyword, and if you use the alias, `pnpm run dev`
     becomes `pn dev`
